\title{Spectral irradiance for diverse optical filters}
\format{A \code{"filter_mspct"} object containing several
  \code{"filter_spct"}.}
\usage{
filters.mspct
}
\description{
A collection of transmittance spectra for optical filters
  from different suppliers.
}
\details{
The \code{"filter_mspct"} object contains \code{"filter_spct"}
  objects with spectral transmittance data.

  The variables in each member spectrum are as follows: \itemize{ \item
  w.length (nm) \item Tfr (transmittance expressed as a fraction of one) }
}
\note{
Please see the help corresponding to each supplier for details.
