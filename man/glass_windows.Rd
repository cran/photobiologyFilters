\description{
Datasets containing the wavelengths at a 1 nm interval and
tabulated values spectral transmittance for glass windows as used by CIE.
}
\details{
For each of the 26 spectra in the collection the variables are as follows:

\itemize{
  \item w.length (nm)
  \item Tfr (fraction)
}
}
\note{
Data from file \url{http://files.cie.co.at/206.xls}, downloaded 2017-06-25.
Abbreviated names from original .xls file used as member names. Full glass
