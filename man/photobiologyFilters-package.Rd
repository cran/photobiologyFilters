\title{photobiologyFilters: Spectral Transmittance and Spectral Reflectance Data}
\description{
Spectral 'transmittance' data for frequently used filters and 
    similar materials. Plastic sheets and films; photography filters; 
    theatrical gels; machine-vision filters; various types of window glass;
    optical glass and some laboratory plastics and glassware. Spectral 
    reflectance data for frequently encountered materials. Part of the
    'r4photobiology' suite, Aphalo P. J. (2015) <doi:10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14>.

\details{
This package contains transmission spectra for different types of
optical filters and filter-like objects. These spectral data are NOT
normalized. In most cases they have been obtained from sheets of the standard
thickness supplied by sellers. Metadata is stored together with the spectral
data, when available, it includes thickness, an approximate estimate of
Rfr and whether attenuation by the filter is based on reflection, absorption
or both. Beware that when attenuation is by absorption in the body of the
filter, thickness has a strong effect on
the wavelengths at which Tfr = 0.5 is reached for a given material. Be also
aware that some of the data are for total transmittance and some for internal
transmittance. Depending on the type of filter, spectral transmittance
depends more or less strongly on the angle of incidence of radiation. All
measurements included have been done with a angle of incidence that deviates
at most by a 10 degrees from zero (light beam perpendicular to the surface of
the filter). Additional data is provided in the documentation for different
objects, and metadata is also stored as attributes in the individual spectral
objects. When metadata are available, estimates of spectral transmittance for
different thicknesses can be usually computed. The same is true for the
conversion between total and internal transmittance.

In addition to transmittance for semitransparent materials, the package also
contains data on the refractive index as a function of wavelength, for
several different materials. These data allow the estimation of spectral
reflectance for these materials.

Spectral reflectance data is included for some common metals and for
natural and man-made surfaces relevant to remote sensing.

Transmittance data are included for:
\itemize{
  \item The whole catalogue of Schott optical filters (official data
  supplied by Schott for inclussion in this package).
  \item Most of the catalogue of MIDOPT filters (official data
  extracted from dowloaded files from supplier, reproduced with permission).
  \item Clear glass as used in windows (as used by CIE, from data file
  downloaded from CIE's server.)
  \item Several types of Plexiglas from Evonik measured at our lab.
  \item Other types of plastic sheets supplied by Foiltek Oy and Etola Oy,
  measured at our lab.
  \item Plastic films from McDermit and Courtaulds,
  measured at our lab.
  \item Several types of theatrical 'gels' from Lee, Rosco, and Formmatt.
  Some measured at our lab and others data digitized from manufacturers'
  catalogues.
  \item Films used as greenhouse cladding from  BPI Agri/Visqueen,
  XL-horticulture and generic, measured at our lab.
  \item Various filters used in UV, VIS and IR imaging and photography.

\section{Warning!}{
 Except for those from Schott and MIDOPT, none of the
  spectral data included in this package are "official" specifications. In
  all cases data are only for information, as even suppliers refer to the
  data provided as typical. Spectral transmittance depends on the measurement
  conditions, and, even more importantly, among individual production batches
  of filter materials. Spectral specifications are usually given as reference
  values. Both glass and plastic filters also age: their spectral properties
  change as a result of exposure to radiation or the gases in the atmosphere.
  Aging is in some cases fast. Another point to keep in mind is that some
  filter suppliers, for example Rosco, have changed the spectral
  transmittance of some filters over the years without changing the code or
  name under which they are sold. In other words, the data provided here are
  not a substitute for actual measurements of transmission spectra of the
  filters actually used in a given piece of scientific research. For less
  demanding situations the data are in most cases useful, but perfect
  agreement with measurements on other batches of filters of the same exact
  type should not be expected.
