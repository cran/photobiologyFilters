\description{
Datasets containing the wavelengths at a 1 nm interval and
tabulated values spectral transmittance for different filters used on
light sources as spectral modifiers. Frequently called "theatrical gels".
}
\details{
The variables are as follows:

\itemize{
  \item w.length (nm)
  \item Tfr (fraction)
}
}
\note{
Instruments used: Shimadzu UV-2501 PC (Shimadzu Suzhou Instruments Manufacturing
Co. Ltd, China) equiped with an integrating sphere for Rosco filters except no. 299
which was measured with an Agilent 8453 array spectrophotometer and while
spectra for Lee gels have been digitized from the spectra in the Lee
filters catalogue.
