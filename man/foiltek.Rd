thick polycarbonate, PS is 3 mm thick polystyrene PET_G is polyester approx 3
mm thick and PVC is polyvinylchloride approximately 1.5--2 mm thick all from
unknown manufacturers but stock product in Foiltek's catalogue. Data are to
be used as "reference values only" as values may change in time and
