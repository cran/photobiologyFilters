\description{
Names of datasets containing the wavelengths and tabulated values for
fractional spectral trabsmittance according to their type or optical
properties. Band-pass filters transmit a range of wavelengths, but block
shorter and longer ones. Long-pass filters absorb wavelengths shorter than
their cut-off and short-pass filters absorb wavelengths longer than their
cut-off.
}
\note{
These vectors include only optical-glass filters with well defined
characteristics.
