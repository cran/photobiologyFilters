## Introduction

This package, is a data only package, part of a suite, which has package 
'photobiology' at its core. Please visit (http://www.r4photobiology.info/) 
for additional information. For details on plotting spectra, please consult the 
documentation for package 'ggspectra', and for information on the calculation 
of summaries and maths operations between spectra, please, consult the 
documentation for package 'photobiology'.

```{r}
library(photobiology)
library(photobiologyWavebands)
library(photobiologyFilters)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspectra)
```

In this very brief User Guide we describe how to access individual spectra or
subsets of spectra.

## The data

Spectral data is included both for optical filters, sold as such, and for
materials that either on purpose or by accident may be interposed in the "light"
path in photobiological experiments, including plastic sheets and films. It must
be kept in mind that, 1) absorptance depends on the thickness of a filter in
addition to the properties of the material it is made off, and that 2) reflectance 
depends on the angle of incidence of the light beam. 

The spectral data have been acquired with an assortment of different
instruments. Some data are measured by the authors with spectrophotometers,
others have been provided by filter manufacturers.

The difference in resolution and slit function among instruments can give, for
the same filter, measured "apparent" peaks and valleys of slightly different
width, and slopes of slightly different steepness. This is an inevitable
artefact of spectral measurements, but as except for some dichroic (=
interference) filters have relatively wide ("Gaussian") peaks the distortion is
small.

Another important consideration is that some materials scatter transmitted and
reflected light, and consequently such materials can be accurately measured by
only use of an integrating sphere. Data included here have been in many cases
measured without an integrating sphere; i.e. only by assessing the direct beam.
For non-scattering materials this causes minor errors.

Glass-filter properties vary to some extent among melt batches. Variation can
also be expected among batches of plastic filters. Furthermore, filters age
upon exposure to light and UV radiation, and in some cases even upon
exposure to air. Ageing is not limited to plastic filters and can also affect
optical glass.

We do not provide spectral reflectance data for the filters in this collection,
as we do not have such data available. For filters made of ionic glass and 
coloured plastics, reflection is not selective, and amounts to about 9 to 10\%
of radiation incident at an angle close to perpendicular to the surface.
Anti-reflection coating (ARC) reduces reflections, and multi-coating (MC) even
further. Such coatings are not equally effective at all wavelengths and, 
consequently, their use can modify the spectral properties of a filter. In
contrast to the filters described above, dichroic or interference filters
reflect the "rejected" radiation. It is also possible to produce filters that
have an absorbing glass as substrate and a dichroic coating deposited onto
one or both of its surfaces.

All the spectral data in this package are stored in a single R object, a
collection of spectra of class `filter_spct`. Individual or subsets of spectra
can be retrieved by _name_. The package includes also several `character`
vectors of _names_, each one containing names for LEDs of a given _color_, a
given _type_ or from a given _manufacturer_. These are listed in the help index
for the package. The _names_ used are in most cases the codes used by the
manufacturers for the given type. Any dashes in these codes have been replaced
by underscores.

```{r}
# band_pass
```

```{r}
schott
```

## Accessing individual spectra

The `filter_spct` member objects in `filters.mspct` can be accessed through their
names or through a numeric index. As the numeric indexes are likely to change 
with updates to the package, their use is discouraged. Names as character
strings should be used instead. The names are listed in the documentation
and also available through the "Data Catalogue" vignette. They can also be
listed with method `names()`.

```{r}
names(filters.mspct)
```

We can use a character string as index to extract an individual `filter_spct`
object.

```{r}
filters.mspct$UG11
```

```{r}
filters.mspct[["UG11"]]
```

Be aware that according to R's rules, using single square brackets will return
a `filter_mspct` object possibly of length one. This statement is not equivalent
to the one in the chunk immediately above.

```{r}
filters.mspct["UG11"]
```

Of course, with this syntax it is possible to use a vector of member names.

## Accessing subsets of spectra

We can subset the `filter_mspct` object by indexing with vectors of character
strings. The package provides some predefined ones, and users can easily
define their own, either as constants or through computation. Here we use
a vector defined by the package.

```{r}
filters.mspct[petri_dishes]
```

And below we use a computed one. In this case we extract the member spectra
with names containing the string "UG".

```{r}
filters.mspct[grep("UG", names(filters.mspct))]
```

## Querying metadata

If package 'photobiology' is loaded then the specialised `print()` method will be
used and a summary of the metadata will be included in the header of the
printout.

```{r}
filters.mspct$UG11
```

```{r}
getWhatMeasured(filters.mspct$UG11)
getWhenMeasured(filters.mspct$UG11)
```

```{r}
is_normalized(filters.mspct$UG11)
```

```{r}
comment(filters.mspct$UG11)
names(filters.mspct$UG11)
```

Of the different metadata items, the type of data is of great importance.
Transmittance (and absorptance) can be expressed in two different ways: 
1) taking incident radiation as reference, or 2) taking radiation entering
the material as reference (i.e. discounting reflection). 1) is referred as
_total_ transmittance while 2) is referred as _internal_ transmittance.
Attribute `Tfr.type" is used to store this information.

```{r}
getTfrType(filters.mspct$UG11)
```

## Plotting

Spectra can be plotted in the same ways as other data stored in
data frames, using base R graphics, package 'lattice' or 'ggplot2'. However, another
package in our suite, 'ggspectra', built as an extension to 'ggplot2' makes 
plotting spectra extremely easy.

`plot()` methods use the metadata in the objects to set labels and decorations,
as well as automatically setting the mapping of the _x_ and _y_ aesthetics.

```{r}
plot(filters.mspct$UG11)
```

```{r}
plot(filters.mspct$TB550_660_850, 
     annotations = c("+", "title:what"), 
     span = 11)
```

Package 'ggspectra' also defines specializations of method `ggplot()` for 
spectra.

```{r}
ggplot(filters.mspct$UG11) +
  geom_line()
```

## Calculating summaries

```{r}
transmittance(filters.mspct$UG11, UVA())
```
```{r}
absorbance(filters.mspct$UG11, list(UVA(), Red()))
```

```{r}
transmittance(filters.mspct[grep("UG", names(filters.mspct))], 
              list(UVB(), UVA()))
```

## Using the data in other contexts

As `filter_mspct` is a class derived from `list`, and `filter_spct` is derived from
`tibble::tible` which is a mostly compatible reimplementation of `data.frame` the
data can be used very easily with any R function.

```{r}
head(as.data.frame(filters.mspct$UG11))
```

Of course `attach` and `with` also work as expected.
```{r}
attach(filters.mspct)
transmittance(UG11, UVA())
detach(filters.mspct)
```
```{r}
attach(filters.mspct)
with(UG11, range(w.length))
detach(filters.mspct)
```

```{r}
with(filters.mspct, transmittance(UG11, UVA()))
```
