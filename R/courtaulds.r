#' @title Filter spectra data for cellulose di-acetate film
#'
#' @description Datasets containing the wavelengths at a 1 nm interval and
#' tabulated values spectral transmittance for Courtaulds di-acetate films.
#'
#' 1) Films (0.115 mm thick) stretched 25 cm below lamps Q-Panel UVB313 and
#' exposed to UV radiaition from different lengths of time per day. All films
#' were installed and sampled at the same time. The digits give the number of
#' minutes per day that the lamps were on.
#'
#' 2) New films of different thicknesses.
#'
#' @details For each spectrum in the collection the variables are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item w.length (nm)
#'   \item Tfr (fraction)
#' }
#'
#' @note Instrument used: Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer
#'   without an integrating sphere.
#'
#' @note Idependent measurement of a single sample, not a specification.
#'
#' @docType data

#' @format A vector of character strings.
