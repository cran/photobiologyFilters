#' Indexing of photography filters
#'
#' Vectors of names of member objects with spectral data for filters intended to
#' be used on camera lenses, grouped by supplier. Suppliers: B+W, Formatt-Hitech
#' (Hitech, Firecrest), Fotga, Haida, Heliopan, Hoya, Ken & Faith Concept,
#' KinghtX, KolariVision, Purshee, Rocolax, Tangsinuo, Tiffen, UVRoptics, Zeiss,
#' and Zomei.
#'
#' @section Warning!: Data are to be used as \emph{"reference values only"} as
#'   actual transmittance may change in time and with production batch or glass
#'   melt. In some cases spectra for multiple filters of the same brand and type
#'   are included and show such variation. In other words, these spectra are
#'   measured in individual filters, other filters of the same type and brand
#'   will almost surely differ to some extent in their spectra.
#'
#'   The dynamic range of the data depends on the instrument used for the
#'   measurements. Most of the photography filters have been measured with an
#'   Agilent 8453 array spectrophotometer. The noise floor is at approximately
#'   3.5 to 4.0 absorbance units within the range of wavelengths included in the
#'   data. Some small apparent "leaks" maybe only noise. A blank and a dark
#'   measurement obtained using this instrument are also included in the data
#'   set for comparison.
#'
#' The variables are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{ \item w.length (nm) \item Tfr (fraction) }
