#' Indexing of UQG filters

#' Vectors of names of member objects containing spectral data for for UQG
#' optical glass absorptive and interference (dichroic) filters. Data measured
#' by P. J. Aphalo with an Agilent 8453 array spectrophotometer. Some of the
#' filters are Schott glass and we have retained the Schott type names.

#' @section DISCLAIMER: These spectral transmittance data are based on the
#'   measurement of a single filter of each type. Filters from other production
#'   batches may differ in their spectral properties, specially for wavelengths
#'   outside the range described in the manufacturer's published specifications.
#'   The characteristics of some types of glass filters may change with time
#'   through surface oxidation or by effect of exposure to radiation including
#'   solar radiation. The data provided is to be used only as a coarse guide.
#'   When filter properties are important the filter actually used should be
#'   measured.
