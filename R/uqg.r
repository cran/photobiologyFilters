#' Total transmittance for UQG filters
#'
#' Total transmittance for UQG optical glass absorptive and interference
#' (dichroic) filters. Data measured by P. J. Aphalo with an Agilet 8453 array
#' spectrophotometer. Some of the filters are Schott glass and we have retained
#' the Schott type names.
#'
#' The variables are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{ \item w.length (nm) \item Tfr (fraction) }

#' @section DISCLAIMER: These spectral transmittance data are based on the
#'   measurement of a single filter of each type. Filters from other production
#'   batches may differ in their spectral properties, specially for wavelengths
#'   outside the range described in the manufacturer's published specifications.
#'   The characterisitics of some types of glass filters may change with time
#'   through surface oxidation or by effect of exposure to radiation including
#'   solar radiation. The data provided is to be used only as a coarse guide.
#'   When filter properties are important the filter actually used should be
#'   measured.
