#' Spectral transmittance of plastic covers, climate screens and shade nets
#'
#' A collection of transmittance spectra for plastic covers, climate screens and
#' shade nets used in horticulture. We include under "plastic covers, climate
#' screens and shade nets", nets, cloths and laminated and perforated films with
#' spatially heterogeneous optical properties. We exclude "filters" including
#' all semi-transparent and transparent sheets and films with spatially
#' homogeneous optical properties. Spectra for nearly 200 types of covers,
#' screens, and nets from eight suppliers were measured consistently as
#' described by Kotilainen et al. (2018).
#'
#' The variables for each spectrum are as follows:
#' \itemize{ \item w.length (nm) \item Tfr (fraction) }
#'
#' @details Spectra were measured on new (never used) samples. Optical
#'   properties can be expected to change with ageing due to chemical changes
#'   induced by solar UV radiation and by soiling during the usual life
#'   expectancy of five or more years. Spectral data for twenty four
#'   climate-screen samples (ten Harmony-type, two Luxous-type, seven
#'   Solaro-type and six Tempa-type) and four insect-screen samples provided by
#'   Svensson (AB Ludvig Svensson, KINNA, Sweden,
#'   \url{https://www.ludvigsvensson.com/en/climate-screens}). Twenty-six
#'   shade-net samples (16 Sombra-type and ten Sombra raschel-type (patterned))
#'   and 12 thrip, aphid, and insect -net samples (two Anti-Trip-type, eight
#'   Anti-Afidos-type and two Anti-Insect types) were provided by Mallas
#'   Textiles (Mallas Textiles Fabricantes, Chimalhuacán, Mexico,
#'   \url{https://mallastextilesmx.com/}) were described by Kotilainen et al.
#'   (2018). Additional spectra obtained by the same authors are also included
#'   in this package. If you use these data in publications, please, cite both
#'   Kotilainen et al. (2018) and this package.
#'
#'   The variables in each member spectrum are as follows: \itemize{ \item
#'   \code{w.length} (nm) \item \code{Tfr} (transmittance expressed as a
#'   fraction of one) } These member objects contain metadata stored as R
#'   attributes. Accessors  to the metadata are available:
#'   \code{what_measured()}, \code{how_measured()}, \code{when_measured()},
#'   \code{filter_properties()} and \code{comment()}.
#'
#' @note Please see the help for the indexing vectors for specific details. The
#'   original data of Kotilainen et al. (2018) plus additional spectral data are
#'   available at Zenodo (Robson and Kotilainen, 2018). The data read from file
#'   \code{ScreensNets_irrad_trans.xlsx}, worksheet \code{"database"}, have been
#'   reprocessed to remove noise. The wavelength values have been "thinned" in
#'   featureless regions using as criterion the lack of change in the local
#'   slope to significantly reduce the size of the data set. Lossless
#'   compression was applied to the R data file containing the data set.
