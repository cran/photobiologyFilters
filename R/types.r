#' Indexing of filters of different curve types
#'
#' Vectors of names of member objects grouped according to their type or optical
#' properties. Band-pass filters transmit a range of wavelengths, but block
#' shorter and longer ones. Long-pass filters absorb wavelengths shorter than
#' their cut-off and short-pass filters absorb wavelengths longer than their
#' cut-off. Multi-band and single-band pass filters are listed together.
#'
#' @note These vectors include only optical-glass filters with well defined
#' characteristics.
