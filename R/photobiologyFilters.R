#' @details This package contains transmission spectra for different types of
#' optical filters and filter-like objects. These spectral data are NOT
#' normalized. In most cases they have been obtained from sheets of the standard
#' thickness supplied by sellers. Metadata is stored together with the spectral
#' data, when available, it includes thickness, an approximate estimate of
#' Rfr and whether attenuation by the filter is based on reflection, absorption
#' or both. Beware that when attenuation is by absorption in the body of the
#' filter, thickness has a strong effect on
#' the wavelengths at which Tfr = 0.5 is reached for a given material. Be also
#' aware that some of the data are for total transmittance and some for internal
#' transmittance. Depending on the type of filter, spectral transmittance
#' depends more or less strongly on the angle of incidence of radiation. All
#' measurements included have been done with a angle of incidence that deviates
#' at most by a 10 degrees from zero (light beam perpendicular to the surface of
#' the filter). Additional data is provided in the documentation for different
#' objects, and metadata is also stored as attributes in the individual spectral
#' objects. When metadata are available, estimates of spectral transmittance for
#' different thicknesses can be usually computed. The same is true for the
#' conversion between total and internal transmittance.
#'
#' In addition to transmittance for semitransparent materials, the package also
#' contains data on the refractive index as a function of wavelength, for
#' several different materials. These data allow the estimation of spectral
#' reflectance for these materials.
#'
#' Spectral reflectance data is included for some common metals and for
#' natural and man-made surfaces relevant to remote sensing.
#'
#' Transmittance data are included for:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item The whole catalogue of Schott optical filters (official data
#'   supplied by Schott for inclussion in this package).
#'   \item Most of the catalogue of MIDOPT filters (official data
#'   extracted from dowloaded files from supplier, reproduced with permission).
#'   \item Clear glass as used in windows (as used by CIE, from data file
#'   downloaded from CIE's server.)
#'   \item Several types of Plexiglas from Evonik measured at our lab.
#'   \item Other types of plastic sheets supplied by Foiltek Oy and Etola Oy,
#'   measured at our lab.
#'   \item Plastic films from McDermit and Courtaulds,
#'   measured at our lab.
#'   \item Several types of theatrical 'gels' from Lee, Rosco, and Formmatt.
#'   Some measured at our lab and others data digitized from manufacturers'
#'   catalogues.
#'   \item Films used as greenhouse cladding from  BPI Agri/Visqueen,
#'   XL-horticulture and generic, measured at our lab.
#'   \item Various filters used in UV, VIS and IR imaging and photography.

#' @section Warning!: Except for those from Schott and MIDOPT, none of the
#'   spectral data included in this package are "official" specifications. In
#'   all cases data are only for information, as even suppliers refer to the
#'   data provided as typical. Spectral transmittance depends on the measurement
#'   conditions, and, even more importantly, among individual production batches
#'   of filter materials. Spectral specifications are usually given as reference
#'   values. Both glass and plastic filters also age: their spectral properties
#'   change as a result of exposure to radiation or the gases in the atmosphere.
#'   Aging is in some cases fast. Another point to keep in mind is that some
#'   filter suppliers, for example Rosco, have changed the spectral
#'   transmittance of some filters over the years without changing the code or
#'   name under which they are sold. In other words, the data provided here are
#'   not a substitute for actual measurements of transmission spectra of the
#'   filters actually used in a given piece of scientific research. For less
#'   demanding situations the data are in most cases useful, but perfect
#'   agreement with measurements on other batches of filters of the same exact
#'   type should not be expected.
